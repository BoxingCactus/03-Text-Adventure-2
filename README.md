Text adventure game for class GAME TECHNOLOGY.

This game depicts you as a typical canine in the pound who needs to escape. The only actions used in the game are the directions (N,S,W,E). Accomplishing the in-game map was done by making a simple layout on paper. That way, progress and the correct direction for each room was documented in a simple guide.
